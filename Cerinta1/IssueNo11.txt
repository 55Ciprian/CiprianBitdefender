[Initial state]:
URL page: https://test-bitdef.web.app/reports

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Go to the given url
2. Click on "CREATE REPORT" button
3. Press "SAVE" button without filling in any information

[Expected result]:
The report should not be saved empty

[Actual result]:
The report is saved successfully even if no information was filled in

[Additional information]:
The page contains no mandatory fields, but a report should contain some information (Some fields should be mandatory)
Let's assume you have an empty report, but you don't even have the settings set(Export now or Scheduled), so we don't even know when the report should be created
