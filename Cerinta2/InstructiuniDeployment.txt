Steps to run the test with testcafe
I have used Sublime test to write the test, you don't have to install it.

1. Install Git Bash
2. Install Node.js 
3. Right click in the folder test and use "Git Bash" here
4. Make sure you have npm installed (npm install -g npm in command line) - I have 8.1.2 version installed
5. Install testcafe (npm install -g testcafe in command line)
6. In the Git Bash use "testcafe chrome CreateReport.test.js" command to run the test
7. Enjoy :D
